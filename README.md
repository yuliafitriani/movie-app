# Challenge 8 - Slicing Figma Movie App with Tanstack Query

# Description

In this assignment, you'll translate a provided Figma design into a functional webpage using React Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Tanstack Query.

You'll be provided with a basic project setup, and your task will be to implement the design by writing components that reusable and utilizing Tailwind's classes.

And you also provided REST API from [The MovieDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started), and use it with Tanstack Query and axios to communicated.

Step by Step to use The MovieDB.

- [Register](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) to The MovieDB
- if you already have an account [Login](https://www.themoviedb.org/login?to=read_me&redirect=%2Fdocs%2Fgetting-started)
- Save API Read Access Token and Api Key inside your `.env`. you can find the API Read Access Token and Api Key [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
- Open API Documentation [here](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/getting-started)
- you can use `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/{backdrop_path / poster_path}` to retrieve image from The MovieDB

The design for this assignment is located at the following Figma link:

[Figma Design Link](https://www.figma.com/design/PjR3Adxi8eZbS2cmdPuG52/Front-End-Developer-Test---Movie-Explorer-App?node-id=8411-143671&p=f)

The goal is to assess your ability to:

- Interpret a design from Figma.
- Create a reusable component
- Structure a webpage with React Vite.
- Apply styles using Tailwind CSS.
- Create a responsive layout.
- Routing and rendering method.
- Implement Tanstack Query

# Assignment Objectives

- Figma to HTML: Accurately translate the Figma design into HTML. Create the necessary HTML elements to structure the page (divs, sections, headers, etc.).
- Tailwind CSS Styling: Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the HTML elements. Pay close attention to:
- Layout (Flexbox, Grid).
- Spacing (padding, margin).
- Typography (font sizes, weights, colors).
- Colors and Backgrounds.
- esponsive design (using Tailwind's responsive prefixes, e.g., md:, lg:).
- Responsive Design: Ensure your implementation is responsive across different screen sizes, as defined in the Figma design. Use Tailwind's responsive modifiers.
- Adherence to Design: Your final webpage should closely match the visual design provided in the Figma file.
- Implement The MovieDB using Tanstack Query and Axios.

# Getting Started

for this project first, then to run the app, run

```
npm run dev
```

on terminal

Study the Figma Design: Open the Figma link and thoroughly examine the design. Understand the layout, spacing, colors, typography, and responsive behavior.

HTML Structure: Open the public/index.html file. Begin by structuring the page with HTML elements that mirror the design.

Tailwind CSS: Use Tailwind CSS classes directly within your HTML elements to apply styles. For example:

<div class="flex justify-center items-center">...</div>

<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">...</h1>

Test in the Browser: Run npm run dev to see it on your browser

Iterate: Continue to refine your HTML and Tailwind CSS until your webpage accurately matches the Figma design.

# Important Notes

You can modify the folder structure only on src and public folder, don't change anything related to project setup

Tailwind CSS Documentation: Refer to the official Tailwind CSS documentation (https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for information on available classes and how to use them.

Figma Inspection: Use the "Inspect" feature in Figma to get precise measurements, colors, and font styles from the design.

# Evaluation System

The evaluation for this assignment will be based on the following criteria:

1.  **Basic concept and project structure:** How you understand the concept of React Vite and how you manage the project structure
2.  **Tanstack Query** How you understand about Tanstack Query to retrieve data from The MovieDB API.
